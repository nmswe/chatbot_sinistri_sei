<p>
  This project was born out of the <a href="https://www.tomorrowdevs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tomorrow Devs Summer Camp</strong></a> experience.
  It was created with the goal of learning how to build a full-fledged chatbot application from scratch, including deployment.
</p>


<p>
  The challenge was: <em>"Build a chatbot that simulates an endless phone hold, with multiple personalities, that is both entertaining and frustrating."</em>
</p>

<p>
  This is our take on that challenge.
